# **Team Illusion Constitution Draft**


## Preamble

We, the people of Team Illusion (the **“Club”**), join together to form one body to govern the Club. The Club’s operations will adhere to the principles of democracy when proper guidance on a matter isn’t present in this document. The Club should always act in a way that fosters a productive, diverse, and positive learning environment for its members. One up to date physical copy of this constitution should be held by the secretary.

## I. **Executive Roles**

This section of the constitution outlines the different executive positions and their rights and responsibilities. This is not an exhaustive list of all roles, and thus this list may be edited through amendments. Any powers not explicitly given to a position can only be executed through a vote of each of these roles. These powers will be held in a seperate document, where any rules are placed. Any one official cannot hold more than one role during the same year.


### Voting Procedure

Any decision that needs to be decided via an executive vote (a “Vote”) should be executed in such a way that any executives who are not present can vote. **The standard amount of time for a Vote should be 7 days**, however this can be changed if it is deemed urgent (in which case the period should be shortened) or if a holiday will interrupt the 7-day voting period (in which case it should be extended by the total time off). If the majority of the voting body is absent, the Vote should be postponed.

### **Club President**

The **President of the Club** is the overarching authority over the entire club. All other roles, executive or not, are to report to this **President**.

### **Club Vice President**

Becomes **President of** **the Club** in the event that the true **President** is absent. This role has no other rights/responsibilities.

### **Secretary**

Directly serves the presidents, additionally organizing meetings, documentation, and/or any club reports.

### **Scrum Master**

Facilitates the Scrum framework in the club. Should be Scrum Certified (or at least familiar with the framework). Their primary responsibility is to ensure that the club’s environment is as conducive as possible to productivity, and to help remove obstacles in the progression of work.

### **Freshman Representative**

Represents the interests of any freshman members. Akin to a Congressperson.

### **Treasurer**

Manages the team’s funding. Controls fundraising, budgeting, spending, and overall management of the **Treasury**.

# II. **Elections**

This section outlines the rules and procedure of **the Club’s** elections.

### 1. **Election Procedure**

Voting should be done via the [Borda count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count) method. Candidates or members who are not present **must** still have the ability to participate in the electoral process.


#### In the event that there are no candidates for an executive role:

1. Nominations will remain open until a new candidate is found.

2. The executive roles should convene and hold a Vote to find someone to fill the role temporarily. This temporary appointment does not have to follow any qualifications, including the term requirements, and does not count towards the official’s term limit.

3. When a new candidate is found, they should replace the temporary appointment. 

### 2. **Nomination Requirements**

All nominated officers are required to have been a member until the end of their competition, if applicable (otherwise the school year, the date of which will be derived from the PGCPS Calendar).

You may not run for executive roles for which you have served for more than 3 years, starting from when you first are elected.

### 3. **Removal from Office**

Upon removal, an official will be immediately removed from power and cannot be nominated the following school year. A removed official must be immediately replaced by a **temporary role**. Removal of officials can occur given that the majority of current executives (excluding the subject of the removal) vote for their removal. In the event of a tie, a vote will be held among the members of the club. The outcome of this vote will be the outcome of the removal.

Grounds for removal may include, but are not limited to, misconduct, neglect of duties, or other actions detrimental to the club's mission and values.

### 4. **Competition Roles**

The Competition President's election should be scheduled (but does not have to be held) within two weeks of the official release of competition game information and rules for the year. The election process will follow the standard procedure outlined in the Elections section of this constitution.
